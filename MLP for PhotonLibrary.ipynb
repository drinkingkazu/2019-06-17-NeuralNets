    "A photon library is a look-up map for a LArTPC detector. Provided (x,y,z) position, a photon library provides a probability of detecting a photon by individual PMT. Why do we use a photon library? Because simulation of individual photon propagation requires ray tracing, and it is hard to use a parametric function for approximation due to stochastic physics processes (scattering) and often a complicated detector geometry (field cage, anode wires, cryostat, etc.). A downside of using a photon library is the memory as it needs to hold infomration of probability per PMT (floating point value * PMT counts) for every single voxelized volume in the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method to a photon library is a neural network, which is good at function approximation. This notebook is an attempt to emulate a photon library with MLP."
